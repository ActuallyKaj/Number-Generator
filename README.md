# Number Generator
A number generator with GUI. It will be made using Python, taking inputs from the user to calulate things such as the range in which the number will be generated. I will 
also attempt to make a GUI for it, simple albeit functional. This will be the first time I ever make a GUI, as well as my first project on GitHub.

## GUI
For the GUI of this program, I will be making use of PySimpleGUI. It uses components from Tkinter, PyQt, wxPython and Remi.
