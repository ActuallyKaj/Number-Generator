# Number-Generator
A number generator with GUI. It will be made using Python, taking inputs from the user to calulate things such as the range in which the number will be generated. I will 
also attempt to make a GUI for it, simple albeit functional. This will be the first time for me making a GUI, as well as my first project on GitHub.
